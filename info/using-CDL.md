## Prerequisites

 1. You will have to open your antivirus software and make an exclusion for "ColDog Locker" and "Fixer".
 2. Store ColDog Locker in a folder in your "Documents" folder. You can make a shortcut to that folder on the Desktop if you wish.

## First Run

 1. Open ColDog Locker.
 2. Accept the terms of the disclaimer
 3. Enter Folder name, then password, and confirm your password.
 4. Document and keep your security code in a safe place.

Your new folder will be created in the same directiory that "ColDog Locker" is in.

## Locking the Folder

 1. Open ColDog Locker.
 2. Type '1' and press enter.

Your folder will be locked and inaccessible until the password has been entered.

## Unlocking the Folder

 1. Open ColDog Locker
 2. Enter your password

Your folder will be unlocked and ready to use.

:warning: If you fail to enter the correct password 10 times, the folder will become locked, and you will have to enter the security code you recieved when creating the locker. If you fail another 4 times, the folder and contents will be deleted, and you will have to create new configuration.

## Deleting Configuration 1

The folder must be unlocked to proceed.

 1. Type '2' on the main menu.
 3. Delete the old folder once you have removed its contents.

If that did not work for you, move to **Deleting Configuration 2**

## Deleting Configuration 2

If you recieve the error "Access denied" or you messed up your configuration on initial creation, follow these steps:

 1. Open Fixer
 2. Type 'y' to remove configuration.
 3. Open ColDog Locker.
 4. Accept the disclaimer and create new configuration.

If you still recieve "Access denied" or the configuration is still messed up, check the following:

 1. Is CAPS lock on?
 2. Is the folder name or password empty?
 3. Are there any spaces in your password?
 4. Did you follow the above steps?
